                    <h3>Wear PFD (Life Jacket)</h3>
                    <p>
                        A properly fitted personal flotation device (PFD) is required for every rafter. It keeps you afloat and helps 
                        you maintain a safe body position if you enter the water.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Wear Helmet</h3>
                    <p>
                        Helmets protect your head from accidental impacts with rocks, paddles, or the raft itself. 
                        They must remain fastened at all times.

                    <h3>Wear Cold-Water Gear</h3>
                    <p>
                        Depending on water temperature, wetsuits or splash jackets help maintain warmth and prevent cold-related injuries 
                        in the event of an unexpected swim.
